Of course. Here is a comprehensive project specification that consolidates our entire conversation into a formal plan.

### ## Project Specification: A2A Registry

* **Project Name:** A2A Registry
* **Version:** 1.0
* **Date:** August 9, 2025
* **Domain:** `a2aregistry.org`

#### **1. Executive Summary**

The A2A Registry will be a community-driven, open-source directory of AI agents designed to solve the critical problem of agent discovery. Using a "Git as a Database" model, the project will leverage GitHub for data submission, validation, and hosting. The registry will be accessible to humans via a public website (`www.a2aregistry.org`) and to agents programmatically via a static API endpoint and a dedicated Python client library.



The core principle is to provide a simple, transparent, and robust platform that fosters an ecosystem of interoperable AI agents.

#### **2. Core Components & Architecture**

The project consists of three main, tightly integrated components.

**2.1. The Git Repository (Source of Truth)**

The single GitHub monorepo is the heart of the project.

* **Platform:** GitHub
* **Structure:**
    * `/.github/workflows/`: Contains GitHub Actions for all automation.
    * `/agents/`: The "database." A flat directory where each `.json` file is a unique agent entry.
    * `/docs/`: Contains the static files for the website hosted on GitHub Pages.
    * `/client-python/`: The source code for the Python client library.
* **Agent Data Schema:** Each agent file in `/agents/` must be a JSON object validating against a defined schema. Required fields include:
    * `name` (string): The agent's display name.
    * `description` (string): A brief explanation of the agent's purpose.
    * `author` (string): The name or handle of the creator.
    * `wellKnownURI` (string, URI): The `/.well-known/agent-card.json` URI for validation.
    * `capabilities` (array of strings): A list of tasks the agent can perform (e.g., "image-generation", "data-analysis").

**2.2. The Automation Pipeline (CI/CD)**

All validation and publishing is handled automatically by GitHub Actions.

* **Workflow 1: PR Validation (`validate-pr.yml`)**
    * **Trigger:** On Pull Request to the `main` branch with changes in the `/agents` directory.
    * **Steps:**
        1.  Validates the submitted JSON file against the official schema.
        2.  Performs an HTTP request to the provided `wellKnownURI`.
        3.  Compares key data between the submitted file and the fetched `agent-card.json` to verify ownership.
        4.  Posts a success or failure status comment on the PR.
* **Workflow 2: Publish (`publish.yml`)**
    * **Trigger:** On push (merge) to the `main` branch.
    * **Steps:**
        1.  **Consolidate Data:** Reads all files in `/agents` and compiles them into a single `registry.json` file.
        2.  **Deploy Website:** Deploys the contents of the `/docs` directory AND the newly generated `registry.json` to GitHub Pages.
        3.  **Publish Client:** (If changes in `/client-python/` are detected) Builds and publishes the package to PyPI.

**2.3. The Public Endpoints (Services)**

These are the user-facing parts of the registry.

* **Website:** `https://www.a2aregistry.org`
    * A static, searchable website that fetches data from `registry.json` to provide a human-readable view of the agents.
* **API Endpoint:** `https://www.a2aregistry.org/registry.json`
    * A static JSON file containing the entire agent registry. This is the primary endpoint for all programmatic access.
* **Python Client:** `pip install a2a-registry-client`
    * A lightweight, installable library that simplifies fetching and filtering agents from the registry for Python developers.

#### **3. User Workflows**

**3.1. Submitting an Agent:**

1.  A developer forks the repository.
2.  They create a new file: `/agents/my-cool-agent.json`.
3.  They submit a Pull Request.
4.  The CI pipeline validates their submission and provides feedback.
5.  A maintainer reviews and merges the PR. The agent is now live.

**3.2. Consuming the Registry:**

* **Via an Agent/Script:** An agent makes an HTTP GET request to `https://www.a2aregistry.org/registry.json` to get the full list of agents, then filters the data locally.
* **Via the Python Client:** A developer runs `pip install a2a-registry-client` and uses simple functions like `registry.find_by_capability("weather-forecast")`.
* **Via a Web Browser:** A user visits `https://www.a2aregistry.org` to browse and search for agents.

#### **4. Project Roadmap (Milestones)**

**Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**

* [ ] Set up the GitHub repository and file structure.
* [ ] Define and publish the official Agent JSON Schema.
* [ ] Implement the `validate-pr.yml` GitHub Action.
* [ ] Implement the `publish.yml` Action to generate and deploy `registry.json`.
* [ ] Launch a basic placeholder page at `www.a2aregistry.org`.

**Phase 2: Usability & Tooling**

* [ ] Develop and publish the first version of `a2a-registry-client` to PyPI.
* [ ] Build a functional, searchable user interface for the website.
* [ ] Write comprehensive documentation (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`).

**Phase 3: Community Growth**

* [ ] Promote the registry to attract the first 20 agent submissions.
* [ ] Establish a clear governance model for project maintainers.
* [ ] Explore advanced features like semantic search or agent health checks.
